# Northern B.C. Climate Research Stations

### Overview

A web-application for visualising and downloading Northern British Columbia climate research data.

### Features

Provides interactive web-application to view climate data station locations, visualise long-term and real-time records (including temperature, precipitation, wind, solar radiation etc), obtain statistical summaries and download data.

### Examples

Below are snapshots of the application showing long-term and real-time climate records.

### Annual Data Updates
Each year, weather station datasets are added to the application. The following contains notes on annual data updates.

1. New station data is provided as one comma separated value file (csv) for each station. The file contains all of the station's historical records up to date.
2. Scripts from `00_prep.R` to `04_output.R` under `R/` directory are run in four steps to integrate new station data to the application.
3. Once updated datasets are written to the `data/` folder, move them under `R/shiny/data` so the application contains updated datasets.
4. The hourly wind data (wind_df_{YYYY}.rds) contains the archived all stations' hourly wind dataframe required to output the windrose plots. Every year, this r binary file gets read in, updated with new hourly wind data. At the end of the update cycle, retain
a zipped file of it and commit to GitHub and remove the original .rds.
5. Remove raw data files and commit only station metadata (xlsx) and wind_df.zip to GitHub repository.

### Project Status

This project is updated annually with new weather station datasets.
